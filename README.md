# Alef
The development of a donation app called (Alef) that helps the user to find the nearest location of Refrigerators, Clothes collecting boxes and Water taps so that they can either give donations or benefit from them.

The whole idea of the application is that you can browse a map based on the user's location and this map shows  the nearest location of the three types of segments: 
- Refrigerators
- Clothing boxes
- Water taps
